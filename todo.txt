{Reggie, The true gambler}

The enemy of all the total violence users out there
{1 hp,1 atk but 100 trk} and he makes sure to make your life Hell
like his use of trk is unique as he manipulates rng to make impossible scenarios
like sureshot not missing but hitting yourself and he uses YOUR coin flips on YOU and ofc he doesnt 
abide by game logic as he spams an attack 50 times a move resulting in 50 dmg and he can skip your turn(sans moment)

reggie drops {reckless animosity} which if you can use when crafting the godslayer


{God Slayer}
Katana + Chain + reckless animosity = godslayer
So it deals 200 dmg per hit, bypasses block and dodge
